# Presentations
Repository used to hold my presentations and blog scripts
SecurityHacks.psm1 is a download from https://www.sqlshack.com/how-to-secure-your-passwords-with-powershell/

## Automation folder
The is for the presentation on how to automate a lot of database work including Docker environments.

## Testing Basics
The TestingBasics folder is for a presentation on how to test databases using different methodologies. Those methods include tSQLt, Pester and DbcCheck. The testing basics presentation is used with another repository I have on GitHub.com/SQLPioneer/AdventureWorks. This additional repository is not necessary, but without it you will need to download your own AdventureWorks database and install tSQLt.
